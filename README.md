## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Telegram chatbot and connect it with the required APIs:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carmenrobres/TelegramChatbot.git
cd TelegramChatbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. Run the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys
Create a .env file in the root directory (where you have main.py) and add your API keys:

```bash
TELEGRAM_API_KEY=your-telegram-api-key
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-telegram-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-langchain-api-key"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="CreAI"
```

*Check up the API Configuration Guide to get your APIs*.

Langchain is not really needed but it can be a key element after if you have a big data base.

### 5. Replace Google API file
*Check up the API Configuration Guide to get more information*
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console.](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new project or select an existing one.
- Enable the Google Drive API and Google Sheets API.
- Download the JSON credentials file and save it as client_key.json in the root directory.
  
### 6. Run the Bot
```bash
python main.py
```

```

## üîß Customization
You can easily customize various aspects of the bot's responses and behavior:

1. **Assistant Role Customization**:
   - In the `Assistant` folder, you‚Äôll find `instructions.txt`. Here, you can define and customize the role of your assistant, tailoring its personality and response style.

2. **Changing the Assistant's Name**:
   - Open `assistant.py` and update the assistant's name on **line 20**. This name will be reflected in your ChatGPT Playground Project.

3. **Telegram Bot Customization**:
   - In `integrations/Telegram.py`, you can modify the following:
     - The **trigger greeting** (line 122): This automated response prevents unnecessary token usage by ChatGPT.
     - The **welcome message** for the `/start` command (line 142).
     - The **welcome message** when a greeting word is detected (line 152).

4. **Database Customization**:
   - The bot uses a JSON file for data storage located at `resources/DataSet.json`. You can modify this file using standard JSON format to update or add new data.

5. **Image Processing Customization**:
   - If you want to change how images are processed, you can update the logic in `integrations/Telegram.py` on **line 250**.

6. **Bot Profile Customization**:
   - To modify the bot‚Äôs name, user image, and description, use **@BotFather** on Telegram.

7. **Flask App Customization**:
   - To modify the  information set on the Flask app go to `templates/index.html`. Right now it has a basic text but you can enhance the app by adding more information.


## üìñ API Configuration Guide

### Telegram Bot API
Open Telegram and search for BotFather.

Use the command /newbot and follow the instructions to create your bot.

Copy the token and paste it into your .env file as TELEGRAM_API_KEY.

### OpenAI API
Go to OpenAI's API [website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

Sign up or log in.

Select a project, go to Dashboard, API keys.

Create a new API key.

Add the API key to your .env file as OPENAI_API_KEY.

### Google Drive API
Create a Google Sheet file. It has to have these columns in this order: `USER |	MESSAGE	 |	ANSWER	 |	TIME`

Go to Google Cloud Console and log in.

Create a new project and enable the Google Drive API and Google Sheets API.

Through API & Services, Create credentials and download the JSON file, saving it as credentials.json.

Share your Google Sheet with the service account email in the JSON file.

Paste the json file as client_key.json in the main folder.


## ü§ñ Usage

Once you have the bot set up and running, you can interact with it directly on Telegram. Here‚Äôs what you can do:

1. **Text Interaction**:
   - Simply type your message to the bot, and it will respond based on the assistant role defined in `instructions.txt`. The bot personalizes its responses using your Telegram username for a more engaging experience.

2. **Audio Interpretation**:
   - You can send voice messages to the bot. It uses Whisper AI to transcribe the audio and then responds accordingly based on the assistant‚Äôs role and personality settings.

3. **Image Interpretation**:
   - Share an image with the bot, and it will analyze it using DALL-E API, providing a detailed response based on the image and text you add.

4. **Automated Greeting**:
   - When you start the chat with the `/start` command or send a greeting, the bot automatically sends a welcome message without using extra tokens from the ChatGPT API.

5.**Basic Flask Server**:
   - The project also includes a small Flask server that currently serves a simple text information. This sets the stage for potential future web-based enhancements.


Enjoy your personalized chatbot experience and feel free to customize the bot‚Äôs role to fit your needs!
